# Open WebUI (Personal Fork) 🚀

👋 Welcome to my personal fork of [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)! This is a space where I'm testing, experimenting, and developing some additional features for the project. Feel free to take a look around and follow along with my progress!

## What is Open WebUI? 💡

Open WebUI is an open-source, user-friendly, self-hosted web interface for interacting with various large language models (LLMs) like **Ollama** and **OpenAI**. It allows you to chat with AI models and integrate custom functionality, all while running offline!

## My Goals for This Fork 🎯

This fork is primarily for testing purposes, but I also aim to:

- 🔧 Explore new integrations with additional APIs and model runners
- 🧩 Experiment with new plugins using the **Pipelines Plugin Framework**
- 🚀 Test performance improvements and custom deployment strategies
- 💻 Add new features like enhanced **Markdown/LaTeX support** or **Voice/Video call capabilities**

## Installation 📦

### Using Docker 🐳

You can spin up Open WebUI quickly using Docker. Here’s how I’ve set it up:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Make sure to check out the [official documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) for more details on how to get started.

## Current Focus 🛠️

I’m currently working on:

1. 💻 **Testing API integrations** with OpenAI, Ollama, and others
2. 🔧 **Enhancing user customization** for model interactions
3. 📈 **Optimizing performance** for local deployments
